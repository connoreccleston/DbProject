MAJOR BUGS:

None.


ALL BUGS:

Exiting reserve with ID 0 has nextInt error.

Add "0 to go back" to other methods if there's time.

Can't change whether you trust a user or not. (Not specified one way or other in doc.)

Sometimes called TH, sometimes called housing option, make consistant.

Need to trim() keywords before searching table for them or inserting them.

Exceptions/errors in TH.java use System.out instead of System.err.

No space after colon when asking for TH's URL or after asking for keyword list.

Missing periods in several places in TH.java.

Period is created in table even if listing is not added.

Doubles printed from SQL output have 6 decimal places, should probably be 2.

System.out and System.err printing out of order, don't know if this can be fixed.

When you record a stay, you enter a price, should this instead be copied from your reservation?

Change instances of "Integer.parseInt(results.getString("whatever"))" to "results.getInt("whatever")"
