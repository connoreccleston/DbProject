ALL BUGS:

Exiting reserve with ID 0 has nextInt error.

Add "0 to go back" to other methods if there's time.

Able to favorite housing you've never visited!

Able to leave feedback for housing you've never visited!

Can leave feedback multiple times for the same TH!

Can't change whether you trust a user or not.

Sometimes called TH, sometimes called housing (option), make consistant.

Need to trim() keywords before searching table for them or inserting them.

Exceptions/errors in TH.java use System.out instead of System.err.

No space after colon when asking for TH's URL or after asking for keyword list.

Missing periods in several places in TH.java.

Period is created in table even if listing is not added.

Doubles printed from SQL output have 6 decimal places, should probably be 2.

Making a reservation causes the period it was previously available to become 0 days long.

System.out and System.err printing out of order, don't know if this can be fixed.

When you record a stay, you enter a price, should this instead be copied from your reservation?

Cost in Visit is an int, not a double.

Usefulness is broken!

Separation is broken (fails check 3)!

TH listing is not removed from availability when someone reserves it!
